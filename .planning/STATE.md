# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-04)

**Core value:** A late-night, impulsive version of the user cannot quietly loosen their own curfew — loosening costs a limited weekly token, and hand-editing the raw config silently reverts.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Trust Kernel

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Trust Kernel)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase complete
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-06-04 — Completed Plan 01-02 (HMAC-SHA256 sign/verify + DPAPI key store)

Progress: [███████░░░] 67%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1]: DPAPI-stored HMAC key shared by Rust + PowerShell (raw `CryptProtectData` blob, never SecureString framing).
- [Phase 1]: HMAC input form LOCKED to raw file bytes (resolved in 01-01); writer emits one byte form (UTF-8/no-BOM/LF/one-trailing-newline); empty/BOM-only -> single LF.
- [Phase 1]: Atomic write hand-rolled (temp+rename in same parent dir, no tempfile crate) to guarantee atomic same-volume rename on Windows.
- [Phase 2]: Direction classifier is Rust-only; the guard is direction-agnostic (reverts anything not matching the signature).
- [Phase 5]: Propagation fix is instance-level config, not product surface — point the hook at the LifeOS canonical config (zero-copy).
- [Phase 1]: HMAC-SHA256 known-answer vector = HMAC(32x0x0b, "Hi There") derived via an RFC 4231 TC1-faithful oracle (resolved in 01-02); constant-time verify via `verify_slice`, never `==`; signer hashes raw bytes (no internal normalization).
- [Phase 1]: DPAPI key store uses `windows-dpapi` 0.2.0 (`Scope::User`, `None` entropy) — raw `CryptProtectData` blob; 32-not-64 length guard (`KernelError::BadKeyLength`) is the SecureString-framing canary.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: DPAPI + HMAC Rust↔PowerShell interop is the single genuine technical risk — must pass the byte-identical round-trip spike as the phase exit gate.
- [Phase 2]: Verify `sntpc 0.10.1` `sync::get_time` signature and `yamlpatch` round-trip against the actual PowerShell minimal YAML parser at integration.
- [Phase 3]: Verify hook-path resolution under Claude Code junctions before wiring (`$PSScriptRoot\..` may resolve to the drifted `~/.claude/nightguard`).
